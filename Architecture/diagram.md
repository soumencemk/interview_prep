# Diagrams

Tips for diagrams 
-----------------
1. Title : Short and meaningful, number if order is important 
2. Lines : Favour unidirectional arrows, add descriptions for additional info
3. Shapes : Be consistent 
4. Labels : Avoid acronyms, especially those that not all stakeholders would understand
5. Colour : Ensure colour coding is made explicit, watch out for colour blindness and B/W printers
6. Orientation : Place most important stuff in the middle; be consistent across diagrams
7. Keys : Explain shapes, lines, colour, borders acronyms etc.
