# Twelve-Factor App principles

 They were created by developers at Heroku, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) provider, as a set of best practices for building modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications. These principles are intended to guide developers in creating applications that are easy to deploy, scale, and manage in a cloud environment. Here's a summary of the Twelve-Factor App principles:

1. **Codebase**: Maintain a single codebase tracked in version control, with multiple deployments stemming from that codebase.

2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.

3. **Config**: Store configuration in the environment, separate from the code, to allow for easy configuration changes without modifying code.

4. **Backing services**: Treat backing services (databases, caches, queues, etc.) as attached resources accessed via URLs or other credentials stored in the environment.

5. **Build, release, run**: Separate the build, release, and run stages of application deployment, ensuring consistency and enabling easy rollbacks.

6. **Processes**: Execute the application as one or more stateless processes that share nothing, allowing for easy scaling and high availability.

7. **Port binding**: Export services via a port binding mechanism, making the application self-contained and easily accessible.

8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model, rather than scaling up individual processes. This allows for efficient resource utilization and improved resilience.

9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown. Design applications to be disposable, enabling quick replacement and scaling.

10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible to ensure consistency and reduce deployment-related issues.

11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams, writing them to stdout or stderr. Centralize logs for easy aggregation, analysis, and monitoring.

12. **Admin processes**: Run administrative and management tasks as one-off processes in the same environment as the application, rather than via SSH or other means.

These principles provide a comprehensive framework for designing and deploying cloud-native applications that are scalable, resilient, and maintainable, making them well-suited for modern cloud computing environments.
